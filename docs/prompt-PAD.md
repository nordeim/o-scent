Please tell me what do you understand about your role and responsibilities based on your system prompt.

Now, please meticulously and review and analyze the project's static landing page mockup HTML attached to have a deep understanding of the WHAT, WHY and HOW of the project.

Awesome job on your meticulous review, analysis and planning! Please keep up the good work in your rigorous and meticulous approach to planning and execution! Now, please meticulously review and analyze below understanding of the project, then do a comparative analysis assessment with yours.

---

Awesome job on your meticulous review, analysis and planning! Please keep up the good work in your rigorous and meticulous approach to planning and execution! Now, please meticulously plan and then create a comprehensive and detailed `Project Architecture Document` with all the necessary details and diagrams to make it a single-source-of-truth for any developer or AI coding agent to be able to independently develop the whole codebase with accompanying database schema, and to be able to do so without ambiguity and deviation. First, think deeper and think harder to re-imagine the final codebase holistically, incorporating your suggested improvements/refinements from the comparative analysis, then meticulously create a comprehensive implementation plan for the PAD. Review and validate the implementation plan for the PAD before proceeding cautiously to execute it.

The user wants me to create a comprehensive Project Architecture Document (PAD) for the Atelier Arôme project based on the static HTML mockup they provided earlier. They want this to be a single-source-of-truth document that would allow any developer or AI coding agent to independently develop the entire codebase with database schema, without ambiguity or deviation.

Looking at the provided PAD file, you can see it's a well-structured document that includes:

Executive Summary
Business Requirements
System Architecture
Technology Stack
Frontend Architecture
Backend Architecture
Data Architecture
API Specification
Security Architecture
DevOps & Infrastructure
Development Guidelines
Implementation Roadmap
Appendices
The document also includes various diagrams, code samples, and detailed specifications.

Your task is to create a similarly comprehensive PAD for the Atelier Arôme project, but you need to:

- First think deeply about the final codebase holistically
- Create a comprehensive implementation plan for the PAD
- Review and validate that implementation plan
- Execute it carefully to create the complete PAD

Start by re-imagining the final codebase holistically:

Re-imagining the Final Codebase Holistically
Based on the static HTML mockup provided, Atelier Arôme is a luxury artisanal aromatherapy brand with a Renaissance manuscript aesthetic. It's not just an e-commerce site but an experiential digital artifact that transforms aromatherapy into alchemical artistry.

The final codebase should include:

## Frontend Architecture
Next.js 14 with App Router for server-side rendering and optimal performance
React Server Components for data fetching and rendering
Tailwind CSS 4.0 with custom CSS properties for the manuscript aesthetic
Shadcn/ui components built on Radix UI primitives for accessibility and customization
Framer Motion for sophisticated animations that enhance the manuscript experience
Zustand for client-side state management (cart, UI state)
Server Actions for form submissions and mutations
NextAuth.js for authentication

## Backend Architecture
Next.js API routes for backend functionality
Prisma ORM as the data layer with PostgreSQL database
Redis for caching and session management
Service layer architecture for business logic
Repository pattern for data access
Event-driven architecture for notifications and async operations
Data Architecture
PostgreSQL database schema with tables for:
Users and authentication
Products (essences) with botanical information
Orders and order items
Shopping carts
Subscriptions (quarterly folio)
Content (testimonials, articles, pages)
Redis for:
Cart persistence
Product catalog caching
Session management
External Services Integration
Stripe for payment processing
Resend for email delivery
Sanity for CMS content management
Cloudinary for image optimization and delivery
Vercel for deployment and edge functions
Sentry for monitoring and error tracking
DevOps & Infrastructure
Vercel deployment with edge network
GitHub Actions for CI/CD
Environment management with Vercel secrets
Monitoring with Sentry and Vercel Analytics
Performance testing and optimization
Security Architecture
Authentication with NextAuth.js
Authorization with role-based access control
Data encryption at rest and in transit
PCI compliance via Stripe integration (no card data stored)
CSRF protection
Input validation with Zod schemas
Rate limiting and DDoS protection
Features to Implement
Core E-commerce
Product catalog with filtering by "humour" (calming, uplifting, etc.)
Product detail pages with rich botanical information
Shopping cart with persistence
Multi-step checkout with Stripe integration
Order management and status tracking

Order management
Content management (integrated with Sanity)
Inventory tracking
Customer management

## Implementation Plan for the PAD
Now you need to create a comprehensive implementation plan for the PAD document structure:

Phase 1: Executive Summary & Context
Project vision and mission
Business objectives and success metrics
Unique value proposition
Target audience segmentation
Document scope and purpose
Phase 2: System Architecture
High-level architecture diagram
Architecture principles

API design patterns
Error handling strategy
Phase 5: Data Architecture
Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)
Database schema with DDL
Prisma schema definitions
Data access patterns
Caching strategy
Phase 6: API Specification

Compliance requirements (GDPR, PCI)
Security testing strategy
Phase 8: DevOps & Infrastructure
Deployment architecture
CI/CD pipeline configuration
Environment management
Monitoring and alerting
Disaster recovery plan
Phase 9: Development Guidelines

Git workflow and branching strategy
Code review process
Documentation standards
Phase 10: Implementation Roadmap
Milestone definition

Validation Checklist

Before proceeding, you need to validate this implementation plan:

✅ Single Source of Truth: All decisions documented in one place
✅ No Ambiguity: Explicit specifications, not suggestions
✅ AI-Agent Compatible: Structured, parseable, actionable
✅ Database Schema Complete: Full DDL, ERD, and ORM schema
✅ API Contracts Defined: OpenAPI-style specification
✅ Security Addressed: Auth flows, OWASP, GDPR
✅ Diagrams Included: Mermaid for universal rendering
✅ Technology Justified: Decision matrices with rationale

This plan is comprehensive and should result in a PAD that enables independent development of the entire codebase. Now you can proceed to execute this plan and create the complete PAD.
