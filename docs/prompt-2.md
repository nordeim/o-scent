awesome understanding! I want to build an practical, production ready and full featured web e-commerce platform for a Singapore based small to medium sized company - refer to the frontend web design mockup in 3 static component files below. now, please think deeper and think harder to thoroughly and systematically explore how best to re-imagine a complete codebase architecture for the website with the same frontend design. then meticulously plan and create the detailed comprehensive `Project Architecture Document` with file hierarchy diagram with listing of key files and their description, mermaid diagrams to show the application flowcharts and the database schema.
