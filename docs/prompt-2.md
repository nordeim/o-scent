awesome understanding! I want to build an practical, production ready and full featured web e-commerce platform for a Singapore based small to medium sized company - refer to the frontend web design mockup in 3 static component files below. now, please think deeper and think harder to thoroughly and systematically explore how best to re-imagine a complete codebase architecture for the website with the same frontend design. then meticulously plan and create the detailed comprehensive `Project Architecture Document` with file hierarchy diagram with listing of key files and their description, mermaid diagrams to show the application flowcharts and the database schema.

Now meticulously review and analyze @PAD_review_q.md and @PAD_review_z.md , then review the original @PAD_v1.md , @PAD_v2.md and @PAD_v3.md to have full understanding of the final desired architecture design for the project codebase. Then meticulously plan to create a detailed and comprehensive `MASTER_EXECUTION_PLAN.md` for completing the building of the project codebase in logical independent phases. Include in your `MASTER_EXECUTION_PLAN.md` a list of the files to create/modify, and for each file, describe its features and interfaces, also a checklist for each file. Review and validate your MASTER_EXECUTION_PLAN after creation.
