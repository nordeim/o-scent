Awesome job on your meticulous analysis, planning and execution! Please keep up the good work! Now, please think deeper and think harder to meticulously explore how best to create a complete `Master_Execution_Plan.md` for AI coding agent to follow to build the complete codebase phase by phase. Break down the codebase completion master plan into logical phases that can be executed independently by a coding agent with minimal supervision. Specify the list of files to create for each phase, and for each file, describe its purpose and its interfaces, and include a checklist for each file. Each file will be validated against its checklist after generation. After thinking through a well-thought-out project codebase completion master plan, meticulously plan and then create it. Review and validate the  `Master_Execution_Plan.md` after generation.

**Response Artifact:**  `Master_Execution_Plan.md` for building the codebase in logical and independent phases, with a detailed description and checklist for each phase.
