Awesome job on your meticulous analysis, planning and execution! Please keep up the good work! Now, please think deeper and think harder to meticulously explore how best to create a complete `Master_Execution_Plan.md` for AI coding agent to follow to build the complete codebase phase by phase. Break down the codebase completion master plan into logical phases that can be executed independently by a coding agent with minimal supervision. Specify the list of files to create for each phase, and for each file, describe its purpose and its interfaces, and include a checklist for each file. Each file will be validated against its checklist after generation. After thinking through a well-thought-out project codebase completion master plan, meticulously plan and then create it. Review and validate the  `Master_Execution_Plan.md` after generation.

**Response Artifact:**  `Master_Execution_Plan.md` for building the codebase in logical and independent phases, with a detailed description and checklist for each phase.

Now, please meticulously review and analyze the attached static HTML mockup for the project's main landing page and the attached Project Architecture Document for the project, then meticulously create the comprehensive "master execution plan" for building the complete codebase for the project. Review and validate the master execution plan before **executing it to build the complete codebase for the project**. Below is the understanding of the project.
